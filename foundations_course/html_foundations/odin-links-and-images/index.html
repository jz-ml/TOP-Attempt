  <!--
    The <a> tag or anchor element makes the text a link to another
    destination.
    
    The destination is defined using the href
    (hypertext reference) attribute.

    The target attribute determines where the referenced link will be
    opened. The _self value (default if the attribute is not specified)
    will open the link in the current tab, while the _blank value will
    open the link in a new tab.

    The rel attribute defines the relationship between the current page
    and the referenced link. The noopener is a value that prevents the
    opened link from accessing the webpage it was opened from, and
    noreferrer prevents the opened link from knowing which page or
    resource has a link to it. The noferrer value also inherits
    noopener's behaviour, so it can be used on its own.

    Setting rel with these values adds security to webpages as it can
    prevent phishing attacks.
