          Preheat oil at medium temperature in a sizable pan.

          Crack open eggs into a big enough bowl and lightly whisk them
          until mixed well.
        </li>
        <li>
          Pour bowl of whisked eggs into heated pan and allow the bottom
          of the omelette to cook. Check the bottom of it by lifting it
          with a spatula to make sure it doesn't burn.
        </li>

          Flip the omelette when the bottom has cooked well enough and
          make sure to check the other side doesn't burn.

          Turn the heat off when the omelette is completely cooked and
          transfer to a plate to cool down.

          When cooled down enough, enjoy. Can be served with tomato sauce.
